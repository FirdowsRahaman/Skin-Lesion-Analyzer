# Skin-Lesion-Analyzer

Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed 
potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is 
a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show 
potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Dermatoscopic images are also a suitable source 
to train artificial neural networks to diagnose pigmented skin lesions automatically. Training of neural-network based diagnostic algorithms 
requires a large number of annotated images but the number of high quality dermatoscopic images with reliable diagnoses is limited or restricted 
to only a few classes of diseases.
